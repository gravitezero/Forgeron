    	<p><strong>Welcome on this very first page</strong>
I present to you a very young and small project called <em>unnamed</em>.

</p>
<p>Its purpose is mainly to convert markdown / less files, into a static site.

</p>
<p>For this purpose, it include a very simple template binder :

</p>
<p>before : Include all files in the header key before your content
after : Include all files in the header key after your content
content : The content of your markdown file is write into the content tag in your template.

</p>
<p>All the other tags will be bond to the DOM with the css syntax.

</p>
<p>You can set for example a date, an .author, a #title.
They will be bond to respectively : <date></date>, <anything class="author"></anything>, <anything id="title"></anything></p>
