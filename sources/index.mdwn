title: A *very* simple static site generator
template: index
header: header
footer: footer

**Welcome on this very first page**
I present to you a very young and small project called *unnamed*.

Its purpose is mainly to convert markdown / less files, into a static site.

For this purpose, it include a very simple template binder :

before : Include all files in the header key before your content
after : Include all files in the header key after your content
content : The content of your markdown file is write into the content tag in your template.

All the other tags will be bond to the DOM with the css syntax.

You can set for example a date, an .author, a #title.
They will be bond to respectively : <date></date>, <anything class="author"></anything>, <anything id="title"></anything>
